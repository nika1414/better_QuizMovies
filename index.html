        In 1978, childhood friends Lenny Feder, Eric Lamonsoff, Kurt McKenzie,
        Marcus Higgins, and Rob Hilliard win their junior high basketball
        championship. They celebrate at a lake house with their coach Robert
        "Buzzer" Ferdinando. Thirty years later, Lenny is a wealthy and
        successful Hollywood talent agent, married to fashion designer Roxanne
        and has three children named Greg, Keithie, and Becky. Eric claims to
        co-own a lawn furniture company and has two children named Donna and
        Bean. His wife Sally still breastfeeds Bean. Kurt is a stay-at-home
        father, has two children named Andre and Charlotte, his wife Deanne is
        pregnant with their third child, and her mother Ronzoni lives with them.
        Marcus is a slacker and lothario. Rob is married to his much older
        fourth wife Gloria. When Buzzer dies, the five friends reunite for his
        funeral in their hometown with their families. Lenny rents the Earnshaw
        family's lake house for everyone to stay over Fourth of July weekend,
        though his family is leaving early to attend Roxanne's fashion show in
        Milan. He pushes Greg and Keithie to play outside and runs into his
        childhood opponent Dickie, who claims Lenny's foot was out of bounds
        when he made the winning shot.

      <p class="descr2">
        The next day, Rob attacks Marcus, mistakenly believing that he slept
        with Jasmine, and Marcus admits to feeling insecure compared to his
        happily married friends. Everyone comes clean about the state of their
        lives: Roxanne confronts Lenny for canceling their flight to Milan
        before they left home, and he admits that he wanted their family to have
        a normal vacation; Deanne confronts Kurt for spending time with the
        Feders' nanny Rita, but Kurt retaliates by pointing out how she
        under-appreciates him; Eric reveals that he was laid off from his job;
        and Rob admits what everybody already knows – that he wears a toupee.
        Gloria helps everyone reconcile, and Lenny and Kurt offer to help Eric
        start a new business.
